=======SETUP=======
Setting up the back end proved to be very challenging. Getting the files in the right order was tricky because every time I connected the application to GitHub, it created a new file and would throw the others out of control.

Getting it deployed to Heroku was another great challenge, specifically and mostly due to the incorrect order of files, since the 'manage.py, Procfile, and requirements.txt' all had to be in the root directory and were originally one level deep.

After fixing that, there were problems with the migrations due to some typos.
